Expense Splitting App
The Expense Splitting App allows users to easily split expenses among friends or groups.
Users can enter an expense name and add multiple names of participants. Upon clicking the "Split Expense" button, the app calculates and records the expense split equally among all participants. 
Each split expense record is displayed in a RecyclerView, showing the expense name and participants involved.
